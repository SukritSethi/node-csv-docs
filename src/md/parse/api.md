# CSV Parse API

There are multiple APIs available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Under the hood, they are all based on the same implementation.

* [Sync API](/parse/api/sync/)   
  The sync API provides simplicity, readability and convenience. Like for the callback API, it is meant for small dataset which fit in memory and which usage tolerates waiting for the last record.
* [Stream API](/parse/api/stream/)   
  The stream API might not be the most pleasant API to use but is scalable.
* [Callback API](/parse/api/callback/)   
  The callback API buffers all the emitted data from the stream API into a single object which is passed to a user provided function. Passing a function is easier than implementing the stream events function but it implies that the all dataset must fit into the available memory and it will only be available after the last record has been processed. This is usually not recommended, use the Sync API instead. 
* [Stream API + dataset](/parse/api/stream_callback/)  
  Replace the writable stream with a string or buffer or the readable stream with a callback function.
* [Async iterator API](/parse/api/async_iterator/)   
  The Async iterator API is both scalable and elegant. It takes advantage of the native Readable Stream API upon which the parser is build to iterate over the parsed records.
